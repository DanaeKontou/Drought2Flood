  <h1>About PerfectSTORM 🌧️</h1>
  <p>In PerfectSTORM, we study the risk of cascading hazards of flooding after drought, focusing on hydro-social feedbacks. 
  The project aims to provide guidance on future management of drought-to-flood events to boost the positive impacts of 
  above-average rainfall on drought effects while reducing its impacts.</p>
